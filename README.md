# Why does GitHub updates take so long?
 - i myself(BILLPC2684) is mostly the only one working on this project, so it's a slow process
 - life issues and school blocking from getting work done(plus not to mention other projects)
 - also i'm working on making python3 able to be compiled into TGR bytecode(the design is still being worked on)
## PLEASE BE PATIENT... Updates will come ASAP on schedule(hopefully)

# Are ROMs free?
Yes for the most part, now people can charge or setup a donation system for their ROMs
## We have no responsibility if your ROM gets hacked/modded or republished without your permission

# Building the Emulator
 - What do you mean Build? this is JavaScript mate, just goto the Web Build!
